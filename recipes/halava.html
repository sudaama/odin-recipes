<h1>Halava</h1>
<img src="./images/halava.jpg">
    <p>The most popular if not the most popular dish in the Hare Krishna Movement</p>
    <p>Halava is made from milk, butter, gaur (pure cane sugar) and semolina.</p>
    <p>However, there are many variations on the ingredients which can be used.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Milk or Water</li>
        <li>Butter or Ghee</li>
        <li>Semolina</li>
        <li>Gaur or Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>Optional: Double Crean</li>
        <li>Optional: Bananas, Raisins, Cashews etc</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring 1 litre of full bodied, fresh, organic cows milk slowly to a rolling boil in a decent sized pot.</li>
        <li>Simultaneously, very slowly, melt approx 125g (half a standard block) of organic cows butter or ghee, in a largeish frying pan.</li>
        <li>After the butter (ghee) has melted, add between 3  and 5 standard cups (250ml) of coarse semolina to the melted butter, depending on how dense you want the halava to be</li>
        <li>Make sure the semolina is absorbed into the butter (ghee) by stirring and folding the mixture. The idea is ti fry the semolina in the butter (ghee). This is a rich dish!</li>
        <li>Optional: Mash down two large bananas with a fork into a puree-like consistency</li>
        <li>Add a decent quantity of gaur (or brown sugar) to the milk and make sure it dissolves nicely</li>
        <li>After some time, when gaur has been assimilated into the hot milk and after the semolina has been well plastered, add the semolina to the milk/gaur mix.</li>
        <li>The semolina will be absorbed into the milk mixture like water poured onto sand so keep folding the mix.</li>
        <li>After the mix has become thickish, pour in the banana puree mash and fold into the thick halava</li>
        <li>The halava is almost ready!</li>
        <li>Make a sincere offering to Lord Krishna, present a sample of the halava, coated with double cream for His pleasure</li>
        <li>Serve halava to your relatives,friends, guests! </li>
    </ol>
